This graphical user interface was created using
- Python 3.8
- Kivy 1.10.1

Be carful to uncomment the lines 
inside window.py
    inside the methods
        send_gesture and
        send_signal
accordingly to the comments inside those methods.
The reason they exist is 
to make the gui work without connection.  
We suggest the user to test the connection calling
the method move_hand in wrapper.py inside
a python terminal before uncommenting those lines.
